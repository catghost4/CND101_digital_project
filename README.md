# CND101_project

This project was completed for the digital design course (CND111) during the 9-month training in the Center of Nanoelectronics and Devices (CND - The American University in Cairo).

The project was to develop RTL for an AMBA AHB-APB bridge. My RTL code was inspired by the design made by DWARAKAN RAMANATHAN which is available at https://github.com/DWARAKRAM/AHB2APB-BRIDGE 

I upgraded The previous RTL design to be able to handle cases where the AHB and APB sides have different clock cycles.
